Too Many Resources Need a roadmap.... Need to find out what i know and what i need to learn..?

Day 1: Started With Basic Linux Commands from HackerRank

Day 2: Did More Linux Comands ( More 61 to go)  and found [3MonthPrepList](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/preparation-kits/three-month-preparation-kit/three-month-week-one/challenges) <br>

Day 3? : So it's 05/15/2024  I Have exactly 103 days till my Fall Semester Starts. I guess from today I need to take it a bit seriously!!! <br>
        Goal: Learn All concepts in Neetcode Roadmap and Ability  to Solve Blind75 <br>
        Will Try to Dedicate atleast 1 hour every day to make this Happen. <br>

Leetcode is bascially indentifying what algorithm is required in problem. <br>
Day 4: Got Neetcode Pro and gonna follow the roadmap implemented 217.
